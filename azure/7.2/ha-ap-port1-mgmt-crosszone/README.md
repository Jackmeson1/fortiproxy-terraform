A Terraform script to deploy a FortiProxy-VM Cluster on Azure

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 1.0
* Terraform Provider AzureRM >= 2.24.0
* Terraform Provider Template >= 2.2.0
* Terraform Provider Random >= 3.1.0


## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - Azure Virtual Network with 4 subnets
   - Two FortiProxy-VM (BYOL) instances with four NICs.  Each FortiProxy-VM reside in different zones.
   - Two firewall rules.

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiProxy-VM to Azure:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `variables.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
3. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
4. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiProxy-VM instances:
```sh
Outputs:

ActiveMGMTPublicIP = <Active FPX Management Public IP>
ClusterPublicIP = <Cluster Public IP>
PassiveMGMTPublicIP = <Passive FPX Management Public IP>
Password = <FPX Password>
ResourceGroup = <Resource Group>
Username = <FPX admin>
```

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
