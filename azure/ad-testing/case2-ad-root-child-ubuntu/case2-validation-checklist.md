## üé´ **CORE CHALLENGE: Kerberos Ticket Acquisition**

### Root Domain Ticket Test
- [ ] `kdestroy` clears existing tickets
- [ ] `kinit enterprise.admin@CORP.LOCAL` succeeds
- [ ] Password `TestPass123!` accepted
- [ ] `klist` shows enterprise.admin@CORP.LOCAL principal
- [ ] Ticket has reasonable expiry time
- [ ] No error messages in ticket acquisition

### Child Domain Ticket Test
- [ ] `kdestroy` clears existing tickets
- [ ] `kinit dev.lead@DEV.CORP.LOCAL` succeeds
- [ ] Password `TestPass123!` accepted
- [ ] `klist` shows dev.lead@DEV.CORP.LOCAL principal
- [ ] Ticket has reasonable expiry time
- [ ] No error messages in ticket acquisition

### Multi-User Ticket Test
- [ ] `kinit corp.manager@CORP.LOCAL` works
- [ ] `kinit network.engineer@CORP.LOCAL` works
- [ ] `kinit senior.dev@DEV.CORP.LOCAL` works
- [ ] `kinit qa.engineer@DEV.CORP.LOCAL` works

## üîê LDAP Authentication Validation

### Root Domain LDAP
- [ ] Anonymous LDAP query works
- [ ] Authenticated LDAP with ticket works
- [ ] `ldapwhoami -H ldap://10.0.1.4 -Y GSSAPI` succeeds
- [ ] User searches return expected results
- [ ] Group membership queries work

### Child Domain LDAP
- [ ] Anonymous LDAP query works
- [ ] Authenticated LDAP with ticket works
- [ ] `ldapwhoami -H ldap://10.0.2.4 -Y GSSAPI` succeeds
- [ ] User searches return expected results
- [ ] Group membership queries work

### Global Catalog LDAP
- [ ] Anonymous GC query works (port 3268)
- [ ] Authenticated GC with ticket works
- [ ] Forest-wide user searches work
- [ ] Cross-domain group queries work

## üîó Cross-Domain Authentication Validation

### Root ‚Üí Child Access
- [ ] Get root domain ticket (`kinit enterprise.admin@CORP.LOCAL`)
- [ ] Query child domain LDAP with GSSAPI succeeds
- [ ] Can search child domain users
- [ ] Can access child domain resources

### Child ‚Üí Root Access  
- [ ] Get child domain ticket (`kinit dev.lead@DEV.CORP.LOCAL`)
- [ ] Query root domain LDAP with GSSAPI succeeds
- [ ] Can search root domain users
- [ ] Can access root domain resources

### Trust Verification
- [ ] `klist -T` shows both realms as trusted
- [ ] Cross-realm ticket acquisition works
- [ ] No authentication errors in cross-domain access

## üß™ Comprehensive Test Suite

- [ ] `/opt/multidomain-tests/test-all-domains.sh` runs successfully
- [ ] All network connectivity tests pass
- [ ] All DNS resolution tests pass
- [ ] All port connectivity tests pass
- [ ] All LDAP query tests pass
- [ ] All Kerberos tests pass

## üéØ FortiProxy Integration Readiness

- [ ] Global Catalog accessible (for forest-wide auth)
- [ ] Domain-specific LDAP accessible
- [ ] Service accounts available (svc.fortiproxy, svc.enterprise)
- [ ] Group-based access control functional
- [ ] Search filters working for different user types

## üèÜ Success Confirmation

**The deployment is SUCCESSFUL if ALL of the following work:**

1. ‚úÖ `ssh -i ~/.ssh/case2_key ubuntu@<CLIENT-IP>` connects
2. ‚úÖ `kinit enterprise.admin@CORP.LOCAL` acquires ticket
3. ‚úÖ `kinit dev.lead@DEV.CORP.LOCAL` acquires ticket  
4. ‚úÖ `klist` shows correct principals for both domains
5. ‚úÖ Cross-domain LDAP queries work with tickets
6. ‚úÖ `/opt/multidomain-tests/test-all-domains.sh` passes all tests

## üö® Failure Scenarios & Solutions

### Ticket Acquisition Fails
- Check DNS resolution to domain controllers
- Verify Kerberos port (88) accessibility
- Check user account exists in domain
- Verify password hasn't been changed
- Check time synchronization between client and DCs

### Cross-Domain Access Fails
- Verify trust relationship established
- Check Global Catalog accessibility
- Verify GSSAPI mechanism working
- Check firewall rules between domains

### LDAP Authentication Fails
- Verify LDAP service running (port 389)
- Check LDAP bind credentials
- Verify user has appropriate permissions
- Check LDAP base DN configuration
