# Deployment of a FortiProxy-VM (BYOL) on Azure

## Introduction

A Terraform script to deploy a FortiProxy-VM (BYOL) on Azure

## Requirements

* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 1.0
* Terraform Provider AzureRM >= 3.0
* Terraform Provider Template >= 2.2.0
* Terraform Provider Random >= 3.1.0

## Deployment overview

Terraform deploys the following components:

* Azure Virtual Network with 2 subnets
* One FortiProxy-VM instance with 2 NICs
* Two firewall rules: one for external, one for internal.

## Deployment

To deploy the FortiProxy-VM to Azure:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `variables.tf` file as needed. And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
3. Initialize the providers and modules:

   ```sh
   cd XXXXX
   terraform init
    ```

4. Submit the Terraform plan:

   ```sh
   terraform plan
   ```

5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:

   ```sh
   terraform apply
   ```

7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiProxy-VM instance:

```sh
FPXPublicIP = <FPX Public IP>
Password = <FPX Password>
ResourceGroup = <Resource Group>
Username = <FPX Username>
```

## Destroy the instance

To destroy the instance, use the command:

```sh
terraform destroy
```

## Requirements and limitations

FortiProxy-VM primarily uses BYOL licensing. Ensure you have appropriate licenses before deployment.
